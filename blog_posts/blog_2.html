                <h1>Season of KDE Final Report</h1>
                <p>
                    SoK ended finally on 17th February 2020. I am happy to share that I have completed the project "Add multiple datasets to several activities"
                    and passed the final evaluation!!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I have written a post a few days back to update about my work which you can find over <a href="blog_1.html" target="blank_">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was left with some work to complete as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>To implement multiple datasets to balance scale with ounce.</li>
                        <li>Test the activities on a different platform.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                As now I have implemented datasets to all of the activities as mentioned in my proposal.

                <div class="balance-ounce-activity">
                    <i>Balance scale with ounce</i>
                </div>
                
                <p>As these activities teach the child arthmetic operations by balancing the scales using pounds or ounce. So, I have added the datasets
                    with five different configurations.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/blogs/balance_o.png" alt="Balance scale with ounce multiple datasets" style="width: 800px; height:600px">
                <div class="balance-ounce-activity">
                    <i>Balance ounce multiple datasets with different level selections</i>
                </div>
                <h2>What after SoK???</h2>
                <p>The day I started contributing to this project I have faced a lot of difficulty in the beginning as this was one of my
                    first open source to which I have contributed. But now I am familiar with all of the concepts, principles, and codebase of
                    GCompris. I am looking forward to adding multiple datasets to other activities and add a new activity "Garbage Recycle" to GCompris.

                    Once again a big thanks to all of my mentors Johnny, Emmanuel, Timothee for all of their help and support. I would also like
                    to thanks the KDE community for conducting such a great program every year.
