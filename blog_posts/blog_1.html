                Finally, I am going to write about my experience as a student of Season of KDE 2020. A winter learning new things, learning what matters is not just writing code but writing good code. I would like to thank GCompris and KDE for giving me such an opportunity to be a part of the community and to try to bring happiness to people and kids using it around the world.

            <p>
                I had to complete the following tasks during this period:
                <ol>
                    <li>Improve multiple datasets of clock game activity.</li>
                    <li>Add multiple datasets to balance scales.</li>
                    <li>Add multiple datasets to balance scale with kgs.</li>
                    <li>Add multiple datasets to balance scales with ounce.</li>
                </ol>

            <p>Since few weeks are still left for SoK to come to an end. Till now, I have completed the following tasks:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Implemented new multiple datasets to clock game activity which got merged to the multiple_dataset branch.</li>
                        <li>Added multiple datasets to balance scales activity which is under review by the mentors.</li>
                        <li>Added multiple datasets to balance scales with kgs activity which is under review by the mentors.</li>

                <p><h2>Clockgame Activity:</h2>
                    I started my work on this activity. The goal of this activity is to teach a child how to see the clock. Initially, this activity contains dataset only with two different level selections. I have added the multiple dataset to this
                    activity with 5 different level selections to better fit to the french school learning programs.</p>

                    <p>I have also added a OK button to check the answer. Finally, the datasets has been merged to multiple_dataset branch.</p>

                    <h2>Balance scales activity:</h2>
                    This activity goal is to teach the child about the arithemetic calculation by balancing the scales of different weights. The balance scales activity has 3 sub activities as mentioned above:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Adding multiple datasets to balance scales.</li>
                        <li>Adding multiple datasets to balance scales with kgs.</li>
                        <li>Adding multiple datasets to balance scales with ounce.</li>
                    </ol>
                    I have added multiple datasets to balance scales and balance scales with kgs which is under review by the mentors. </p>

                <i>I am thankful to my mentor Johnny Jazeix and Emmanuel Charruau for giving me this opportunity and helping me always
                    during the SoK period. I have learned a lot of things during this period and have a great learning experience as of development coding.
                I am looking forward to add multiple datasets to other activities after the end of the SoK period.
